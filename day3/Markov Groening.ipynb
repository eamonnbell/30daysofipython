    "Inspired by - and reusing entire chunks of code from - the post/iPython notebook \"The unreasonable effectiveness of Character-level Language Models\" (by [Yoav Goldberg](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/)), in this notebook, I train a n-order character-level Markov model on synopses of a number of \"couch gags\" from the opening credits of _The Simpsons_, which were obtained [here](http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/lists/couch). More comprehensive lists are available elswhere (e.g. Wikia, other fan sites). Apparently the algorithm is similar to that referred to [on Wikpedia, here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociated_press).\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is in dire need of refactoring. The concept of a \"model\" is ripe for characterization as an object, containing the defaultdict that defines it, plus a bunch of methods that train it, parameterize it, and request output from it. Perhaps for a later notebook. After all, it works. Other extensions might include figuring out a way for quirky outputs to be flagged as such, and to reject outputs that are too short, or patently unsyntactic\n",

    "I added a tiny tweak to the implementation. The text generation function takes a seed that should be < `(len(data) - 7)` to stop the implementation starting at the start of the data for its first `history`.\n",
