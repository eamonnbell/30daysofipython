30 days of iPython Noteboook hackery `#30daysofipy`

I suck at Python. I write Python like I'm still 10 years old, programming in QBASIC. I don't even need to be a ~~good~~ better programmer in my line of work (I'm a music student), but it's something that I've wanted to work on for a while, and I know the only way to improve is to write, write, write.

I love iPython Notebook (a.k.a. Jupyter + Python 2 kernel) because it allows me to mess up, fix my mistakes, and run the code again. It also supports cells that contain prose, rendered from Markdown source, so it's a perfect engine for blogging about the code that I intend to write, using the same tool I'm writing the code with.

So, I'll foist my code upon the world. Short projects, one a day, all using iPython and I'll publish the projects in this repository, along with a short post explaining the project, what motivated it, and the process of bringing it into life.

Code and associated files for each day will be contained in a folder labeled `day_x` in this repo.

In order to plan the month ahead so that I'm not scrounging around for ideas, I'll be dumping ideas for projects - and a tentative schedule - here:

- Day 1: [The Color Bach](https://github.com/eamonnbell/30daysofipython/blob/master/day1/The%20Color%20Bach.ipynb)
- Day ?: Foreign Policies
- Day ?: YouTube Trolls "Under The Bridge"
- Day ?: Reely not so Different
- Day ?: Markov Groening
- Day ?: matplotlib implementation of Fibonacci Clock
- Day ?: Beri(O)ld Music; New Pair of Eyes (OpenCV)
- Day ?: Perceptual Hashes and Logo Similarity
- Day ?: QR-RE
- Day ?: BioHasard
